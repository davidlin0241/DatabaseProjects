Projects for Intro to Databases                                         
(Note: the term "homework" was used interchangeably for "project" in this class, as there were no other coding assignments.) 


project 1: writing SQL queries against Postgres using public data                                       
project 2: implement persistent B+ trees in Java

project 4: design two pieces of a relational query optimizer: (1) the cost-estimator and (2) optimal query plan chooser                 
project 5: implement multigranularity locking and integrate it into the codebase
